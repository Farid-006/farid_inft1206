Welcome

Welcome to our fake birdwatching site. If this were a real site, it would be your number one resource for all things birdwatching, whether you are a beginner looking to learn how to get into birding, or an expert wanting to share ideas, tips, and photos with other like-minded people.

So don't waste time! Get what you need, then turn off that computer and get out into the great outdoors!
